            <h3>(Current Project) Appointment Tool for Retailers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>I noticed that almost every appointment based job loses a lot of time getting to that actual appointment. Contacting your client, finding an appointment, register that appointment in your digital, aswell as your analog Calendar etc... Now, my handy tool will do most of the work for you. All your client has to do is choosing a free slot out of your Calendar. Your Client registers with their personal Data, gets a Calendar update and E-Mail confirmation. In return, my System will automatically register the Clients personal Data in your Sales System and book the appointment in your Calendar. So all a Retailer has to actually do is send the link to it's Homepage, where the Client can do all on his own.
